## Data Portability

Data portability refers to the right of end users to obtain and reuse their personal data across different services or platforms in a usable and transferable format.

Data Portability presents in different regulations (e.g. GDPR, PSD2, DMA in Europe) and its purpose is to enable competition and user control in the market for user data.

In 2024, the EU's Digital Markets Act enforced data portability for search and social data through 8 big tech platforms, enabling third parties to request access to the end user's data with the end user's consent.

Where available, Fabric utilizes big tech APIs made available under the Digital Markets Act.

## Fabric Link

Fabric Link is Fabric's client-side component that end users interact with in order to grant Fabric access to their data which then allow B2C services to use that data through Fabric's APIs.

Link can easily be embedded in apps and websites and should primarily be used in this way. For test users, Fabric also supports generating and sending a URL to users to trigger link within the user's browser.

Link is the gateway to securely obtaining the end user's consent for multiple data sources and accessing the processed and enriched user data through Fabric's APIs.

## Digital Self

Digital Self is the most accurate digital representation of an individual user created from multiple data providers.

Imagine being able to understand every single one of your users.

The Digital Self empowers you to do so, with consent from your users. Fabric is creating a personalized Internet where B2C services can access relevant aspects of each user's digital representation.

Fabric makes this entremely simple for users and B2C services so that users can enjoy secure hyper-personalized experiences in just a few clicks and B2C services can increase retention and revenue.
