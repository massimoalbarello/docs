Fabric Link is Fabric’s client-side component that end users interact with in order to grant Fabric secure access to their data. Once this access is established, third-party or B2C services can utilize that data via Fabric’s APIs to deliver richer user experiences and services.

Fabric Link can be embedded directly within web or mobile applications. For testing purposes or user flows without a dedicated frontend, Fabric also supports generating and sending a special URL to end users, allowing them to complete Link in their own browsers.

Fabric Link is the only method of obtaining end-user consent for connecting multiple data sources and for accessing the processed and enriched data through Fabric’s APIs in Production. In testing environments, bypassing Link may be possible depending on your use case and configuration.
