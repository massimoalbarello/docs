## Overview
Fabric Link is Fabric’s client-side component that end users interact with in order to grant Fabric secure access to their data. Once this access is established, third-party or B2C services can utilize that data via Fabric’s APIs to deliver richer user experiences and services.

Fabric Link can be embedded directly within web or mobile applications. For testing purposes or user flows without a dedicated frontend, Fabric also supports generating and sending a special URL to end users, allowing them to complete Link in their own browsers.

Fabric Link is the only method of obtaining end-user consent for connecting multiple data sources and for accessing the processed and enriched data through Fabric’s APIs in Production. 

## Introduction to Fabric Link
When an end user needs to grant access to their data sources—such as Google, TikTok, and LinkedIn—Fabric Link is the user-facing flow that packages:

Authentication: Collecting appropriate user credentials and passing them securely to Fabric.
Error handling: Providing clear, user-friendly error messages and prompts when issues arise with login or data retrieval.
Consent management: Displaying end-user disclosure and consent forms based on regional regulations and your own branding preferences.

Currently, Fabric Link is available as a webview that can be triggered within apps and on the web. Fabric also provides a special URL, which can be used to launch Fabric Link in a standalone browser session, such as through a email or SMS URL.

Over time, Fabric Link will be available through SDKs for modern web browsers and native mobile platforms (iOS, Android, React Native). 

## Using Fabric Link Consents within the Playground
You can create a new Fabric Link Consent by navigating to the Consents tab and clicking on the Create Consent Button. Enter a name for the Consent App and you can then configure the consent parameters as specified below.

When creating new Linked users, you can attach Fabric Link Consents to them to get request access to their data. 

## Customizing the User Experience
Fabric Link offers multiple customization options, including:

Provider selection: Configure which data providers you want to access data from.
Styling: Modify background colors, text labels, redirect URL, and branding elements.
Consent and disclosures: Insert your company’s name and update copy from the Advanced dropdown.

You can manage these customizations through the Fabric Developer Portal, preview changes in real time, and then publish them to production once you’re ready.
