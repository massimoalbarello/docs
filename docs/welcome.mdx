Fabric is the platform for a truly personalized Internet. Imagine an Internet without creepy tracking and companies trying to guess what their users like. Fabric enables:

- Users to share their preferences securely with their favorite apps and websites; and
- Brands to understand what their users want and build experiences tailored to each one of them.

Fabric obtains the user's consent to access their search and social data from Big Tech platforms and processes it to create an accurate digital representation of each user.
Brands can request specific insights derived from the data. This enables them to provide hyper-personalized experiences that users love, all with the user's consent.

## How does it work?

Fabric provides a simple consent flow that can be embedded into apps and websites in <5 lines of code. This enables users to securely grant Fabric access to their data from Big Tech platforms such as Google, Meta, Amazon, TikTok, Pinterest etc.
