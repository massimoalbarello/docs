Fabric is the platform for a truly personalized Internet.

Fabric's mission is to capture all user interactions and create universal user context that B2C services (e.g. consumer apps, brands, agents) can request from individual users.&#x20;

The universality of user context underpins our efforts: a user is a user, whether they are searching on Google or chatting with GPT. It's counterintuitive that different services should have different context about the same end user.&#x20;

Context silo'ed within platforms results in sub-optimal user experiences. The Fabric team witnessed this first hand in our years building consumer applications. Ultimately, the end user is a party to creating context and therefore, end users should be able to **<u>port</u>** their context at their discretion.

Through Fabric Link and APIs, Fabric provides the gateway to rich, portable, universal user context.

Fabric enables:

* End users to share their preferences securely with their favourite apps and websites;

* B2C services to understand what their users want and build tailored experiences.

By design, Fabric **<u>always</u>** obtains the end user's consent to access their search and social data before processing it to make it usable by B2C services.

## How does it work?

Using Fabric Link, B2C services can request access to the end user's data in just a few lines of code.

Link provides a simple consent experience that can be embedded into apps and websites or shared as a URL.&#x20;

This enables users to securely grant Fabric access to their data from supported data sources such as Google, TikTok, Pinterest, LinkedIn etc. The experience for end users to port their data is seamless, taking a few seconds and a couple of clicks for most data sources.

Fabric processes raw user data to make it usable by B2C services and makes it accessible through various APIs, starting with Journeys and Ask APIs.
