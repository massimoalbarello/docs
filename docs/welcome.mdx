Fabric is the platform of the personalized Internet. Imagine an Internet without creepy tracking and companies trying to guess what their users like. Fabric enables:

- users to share their preferences with their favorite apps and websites; and
- companies to know what your users want and build experiences tailored to each one of them.

Fabric obtains the user's consent to accesses their data from Big Tech platforms and processes it to create an accurate digital representation of the user that the user is in control of.
Users can then share specific insights derived from the data with the companies they want. This enables companies to provide hyper-personalized experiences that users love, all with the user's consent.

## How does it work?

Fabric provides a simple consent flow that can be easility embedded into apps and websites and that enables users to grant Fabric access to their data from Big Tech platforms such as Google, Meta and Amazon.

Based on the user's search and social data, Fabric creates an an accurate representation of the user's preferences and makes it accessible to companies with the user's consent. Fabric does not share the user's raw data from Big Tech with third parties, it only makes insights derived from the user's data available. This way, we can guarantee both the user's privacy and what is most valuable to companies: actionable user level insights.
