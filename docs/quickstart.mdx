In this Quickstart:
(1) You will use Fabric's demo users to experiment with the Journeys playground
(2) Start creating your first test user's digital self by connecting their data 

In this Quickstart, you will create your first test user's [Digital Self](/docs/core-concepts#digital-self) by connecting their Google data. You can then query this user's [Digital Self](/docs/core-concepts#digital-self).

## Create a developer profile

First of all, create a [developer profile](https://developer.onfabric.io). This is where you can see all users that log in via Fabric. You can get an overview from the main page:
![Developer dashboard overview](/images/quickstart/dev_dashboard.png "Developer dashboard overview")

## Create a consent flow to get data access

Create a consent flow for your use case by clicking on `Consents` -> `Create Consent`:
![Create consent flow](/images/quickstart/consent_flow.png "Create consent flow")

Make sure to specify the name of the consent flow (`test` in this case) and the callback URL you want your users to be redirected to once they have completed the consent flow (`https://developer.onfabric.io` for this test).

This consent flow can be completely personalized to your use case. 

You can use your logo, update the copy, and specify your own callback URL to redirect the user after they have consented.

## Onboard your first user

You are now ready to onboard your first user. 

First, go back to the [main dashboard](https://developer.onfabric.io), click on `Create Link User` and provide a unique identifier (`test-user` in this case). Once you are done, you will see that a new user has been created:
![Link User](/images/quickstart/link_user.png "Link User")

Click on `>` to go to the user's dashboard:
![User Dashboard](/images/quickstart/user_dashboard.png "User Dashboard")

Then, click again on `>` under `Consent` to select which consent flow to show to `test-user`.
![User Consent](/images/quickstart/user_consent.png "User Consent")

This is the consent flow you just created that can be used to access Google activity 
![User Flow](/images/quickstart/user_flow.png "User Flow")

It takes just a few clicks to grant Fabric access to Google activity. Fabric currently supports Google "Search" and "Shopping" scopes and will make "Youtube" and "Maps" available in the near future. More scopes = more personalized online experiences.
![Share Google Activity](/images/quickstart/share_google_activity.png "Share Google Activity")

That's it! Fabric is now creating the [Digital Self](/docs/core-concepts#digital-self) of your `test-user`.

You can now go back to the dashboard and see a summary of the `test-user` Google activity:

![User Activity](/images/quickstart/user_activity.png "User Activity")

## Ask the user

You can now ask specific question to the [Digital Self](/docs/core-concepts#digital-self) of the `test-user`. For example:
![Ask User](/images/quickstart/ask_user.png "Ask User")

For more insightful answers and even more personalized experiences, the user can also grant Fabric access to their activity on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Pinterest, and much more.

Imagine being able to understand what each of your users want. With Fabric, the most accurate user understanding is one click away!
