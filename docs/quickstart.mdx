In this Quickstart, you will create your own [Digital Self](/docs/core-concepts#digital-self) by connecting your Google activity. You can then ask specific questions to your [Digital Self](/docs/core-concepts#digital-self).

This is what hyper-personalization feels like.

## Create a developer profile

First of all, create a [developer profile](https://developer.onfabric.io). This is where you will be able to see all the users that log in via Fabric. You can get an overview from the main page:
![Developer dashboard overview](/images/quickstart/dev_dashboard.png "Developer dashboard overview")

## Create a consent flow

Create a consent flow for your use case by clicking on `Consents` -> `Create Consent`:
![Create consent flow](/images/quickstart/consent_flow.png "Create consent flow")

Make sure to specify the name of the consent flow (`test` in this case) and the callback URL you want to be redirected to once you authorize Fabric access to your Google activity (`https://developer.onfabric.io` for this test).

## Onboard your first user

You are now ready to onboard your first user (yourself). Ready to create your [Digital Self](/docs/core-concepts#digital-self)?

First, go back to the [main dashboard](https://developer.onfabric.io), click on `Create Link User` and provide a unique identifier (`test-user` in this case). Once you are done, you will see that a new user has been created:
![Link User](/images/quickstart/link_user.png "Link User")

Click on `>` to go to the user's dashboard:
![User Dashboard](/images/quickstart/user_dashboard.png "User Dashboard")

Then, click again on `>` under `Consent` to select which consent flow to show to `test-user`.
![User Consent](/images/quickstart/user_consent.png "User Consent")

At this point, you are shown the consent flow you previously created
![User Flow](/images/quickstart/user_flow.png "User Flow")

This consent flow can be completely personalized to your use case. You can use your logo, update the copy, and specify your own callback URL to redirect the user after they have consented.

In just a few clicks, you can grant Fabric access to your Google activity. Make sure to share both the "Search" and "Shopping" scopes. The more Fabric learns from you, the more personalized your online experiences.

That's it! Fabric is now creating your [Digital Self](/docs/core-concepts#digital-self).

You can now go back to the dashboard of `test-user` and see a summary of the user's Google activity:

![User Activity](/images/quickstart/user_activity.png "User Activity")

## Ask your user

You can now ask specific question to the [Digital Self](/docs/core-concepts#digital-self) of the user you just onboarded. For example:
![Ask User](/images/quickstart/ask_user.png "Ask User")

For more insightful answers and even more personalized experiences, the user can also grant Fabric access to their activity on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Pinterest, and much more.

Imagine being able to understand what each of your users want. With Fabric, the most accurate user understanding is one click away!
