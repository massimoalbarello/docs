<Warning>
Journeys API is currently in beta. Expect changes, an experience that improves (and sometimes breaks!), and a team dedicated to taking your feedback to build the best API for personalization. 
</Warning>

## Overview
Journeys helps you retrieve your end user's search and social journeys (collections of user interactions - read more here[ADD LINK] from Fabric's supported integrations[ADD LINK] on an ongoing basis. 

Currently, you can call the Journeys Endpoint to refresh user journeys being used in your application. Over time, you will be able to keep Journeys up-to-date with webhooks. 

Journeys data includes a textual description of user interactions, the topics associated with the journey, and the timestamp of the journey. Journeys can be filtered by textual context (e.g. "fashion") or time horizon. You can also specify the number of journeys that you would like to fetch by passing in the TopK parameter. For more details, see the Transactions API reference[ADD LINK].
